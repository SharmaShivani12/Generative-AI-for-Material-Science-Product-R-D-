# Diffusion Models for Material Science (SDXL)

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook demonstrating the use of Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) for material-science–oriented image generation.

The goal is to explore how prompt engineering can guide large diffusion models to generate scientific, microscopy-style images suitable for material characterization, defect detection, and segmentation tasks, rather than artistic imagery.

## 🧪 What This Notebook Shows

Use of Stable Diffusion XL for synthetic material image generation

Prompt design for SEM-style microscopy images

Generation of porous polymer microstructures and defects

Memory-safe inference on GPU-constrained environments (Kaggle)

Industrial R&D framing relevant to consumer goods and materials research

## 🔬 Motivation

Real microscopy data can be:

Expensive

Limited

Difficult to annotate

This notebook demonstrates how diffusion models can supplement experimental data by generating controlled, segmentation-ready synthetic images for downstream computer vision workflows.

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)

GPU-based inference

One-image-at-a-time generation (OOM-safe)

No Hugging Face authentication required

Kaggle-compatible setup

## 📌 Intended Use

Synthetic data generation

Defect detection research

Semantic segmentation experiments

Applied AI for material science R&D

## ⚠️ Notes

Images are synthetic and intended for experimentation

Prompts are designed to minimize artistic bias

Notebook is optimized for limited GPU memory
